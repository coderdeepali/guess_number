This is a simple "Guess the Number" game created in Python using Tkinter. Players guess a random number between 1 and 100 within a time limit, with different difficulty levels. The game tracks best scores and provides feedback on guesses. Players can start the game, and if they guess the number in time, they receive a congratulatory message.
